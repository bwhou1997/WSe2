WARNING: |Eqp0 - Eo| > finite_difference_spacing. Linear extrapolation for eqp1
may be inaccurate. You should test the validity of eqp1 by rerunning the
calculation with the self energy evaluated at the eqp0 energies. For that,
use the eqp_outer.dat file, created with eqp.py script and point WFN_outer to
WFN_inner, if you were not already using WFN_outer.
